            <h2>Eternal Kloud</h2>
            <p>Although cloud technology is becoming more and more ubiquitous these days, many don't know that we are the pioneers of that concept. For generations, select families have been tasked with documenting the history of humanity as a species. The first people to develop a writing system also developed data collection (i.e. the census) which naturally evolved into classes and castes, mass surveilance, etc.
            It just so happened that these advancements popped up in the same familial line, so naturally they became keepers of the Kloud. In modern times we have evelved into a modern corporation, are considered more of a server-side rather than client-side operation. </p>

            <h2>Data You Can Trust</h2>
            <p>To keep an operation this large running a certain amount of trust is needed. Once a federally funded entity, we have now privatized to ensure that our vision for the future remains pure. With a recent IPO of 23 billion US dollors, which is the highest in history (we would know) we are encouraged to keep pioneering the future, knowing that we have the support of many like-minded individuals backing us.</p>

            <h2>Family values</h2>
            <p>We are the parent company of many familiar platforms such as Whitepages, and have worked closely with the FBI and CIA as a trusted partner. Nothing is stronger than a bond between family, and our close knit decendnat companies havd been the reason why Klonus has weathered the test of time. You can rest assured that your data is in safe-keeping.</p>
